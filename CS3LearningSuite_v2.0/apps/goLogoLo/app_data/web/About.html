        <h2>About</h2>
        
        <p>The @goLogoLo was conceived of, designed, and implemented by Changrui Zhou
            of Stony Brook University. The framework which was used in this program 
            was created and maintained by
            <a href="http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~richard/">Richard McKenna</a> 
            of 
            <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a>. 
            The application was built in order to create Logo using simple press and drag operation. </p>
